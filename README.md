Notes For Tomorrow:

-Recollect the 1s interval data (240 seconds total)

-Rerecord every channel in tau/10 intervals for tau*4 for each channel

-Linearize data for each channel

-find a way to compile all linearize graphs into one

-Recalculate the tau for each channel after linearizing, change number of sources depending on the linearized data
